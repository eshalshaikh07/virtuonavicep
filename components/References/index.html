Secondly, for the distributed wide area video surveillance system, a tracking optimization method based on multi-camera fusion is proposed. Finally, this paper constructs a Bayesian monitoring event modeling method based on genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the optimized video surveillance system has basically stable delay, signi cantly reduced packet loss rate, and smooth video playback. This method can effectively realize the coordinated tracking of multiple cameras in a wide-area monitoring scenario, achieve high tracking and monitoring performance, and meet the requirements of smart campus construction.</td>
